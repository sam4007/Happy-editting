## 🔄 Recovery

**Important:** All deletions are **permanent** and **cannot be undone**.

If you accidentally delete content:

2. **Manually re-add** videos if they were manual entries
3. **Notes and bookmarks** will need to be recreated

## 💡 Tips

1. **Review before deleting** - Always check the confirmation dialog
2. **Export data first** - Consider backing up important notes
3. **Delete gradually** - Remove individual videos first, then entire playlists
4. **Check progress** - Make sure you've completed videos you want to keep progress for
